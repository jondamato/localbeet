Localbeet is an iOS application that allows users to find great locally-sourced food and share it with their friends. 

To create Localbeet, I built map features into [Meteorgram](https://github.com/meteor-vegas/meteorgram), an Instagram clone developed in [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). 

This is just the prototype and many more features are forthcoming including social integration, a rewards/rating system, and vendor tagging.
